## Development | Dec. 7 - Dec. 11

For the first half of the week, we finished our initial implementations of our traversal and algorithms, and the file I/O code was fully tested with sample data. During the second half of the week, we debugged and fully tested our implementations using our own sample data in addition to using the dataset. On dec. 11, paperwork was finalized, and a presentation video hosted on Illinois Mediaspace was created.
