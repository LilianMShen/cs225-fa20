All testing and running of our code can be done within the individual test case files, located in the tests folder. The musae-twitch dataset, as well as other data used for testing, can be found in /tests/data.

## Fileio
### Files: fileio.h/cpp

## Breadth First Search (BFS)
### Files: BFS.h/cpp

## Dijkstra's Implementation
### Files: dijkstras.h/cpp
For each dataset/graph, create a new dijkstras object with the constructor and input data using the fileio namespace. The test cases are examples for running the code. Use the all-in-one function _**runDijkstras**_ if you only want the path (vector of Edges). If you want to see the current vertices (including adjacent vertices) being visited, uncomment the print statements in dijkstras.cpp.

## Landmark Path Implementation
### Files: landmark.h/cpp
